Game for Android

Project: Whirlwind trip

Company: (Meraya's Lab) self employed

The project “Whirlwind trip” is a casual game in a cartoon style. In essence, the game offers you to go from point A to reach point B and overcome difficult obstacles on your way.

The game is developed, using an LibGDX framework. It includes modules like “Box2D” (a physics engine) and Freetype (a software font engine).

Adobe Photoshop and Tiled Map Editor are used for the design of levels. In Photoshop, tile sets are drawn for every level and then saved as images. Tiled Map Editor is used to generate an XML file based on the picture created in Photoshop. An XML file contains a description of the level structure. Then this file parses the physics engine to build a level. Google AdWords is added to the game for monetization. The game is ready for upload in Google Play once its development is completed.

Now the work on the game is in progress.
